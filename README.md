-What problem were you solving in the projects for this course?
The problem we were solving in the projects for this course was creating pseudo code to implement a simple program to search for courses and print the required information.

-How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
I approached the problem by allowing a user to course data from a file, store the data in an unordered map, and ensure a unique course number.

-How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
The major roadblock was implementing the code in Project 2, but it was easier to complete the project after breaking the problem down into smaller tasks.

-How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
Working on this project has expanded my approach to designing and solving problems and understanding data structures, which can simplify and improve the program.

-How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
This project taught me to write clean and readable code and implement clear comments and descriptive variables.
